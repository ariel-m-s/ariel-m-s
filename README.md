### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Ariel.

I'm curious and easygoing, ready to embark on new adventures. My journey has taken me through various roles, from software to research and teaching. I possess a quick learning and problem-solving knack, allowing me to thrive in diverse environments. I'm genuinely driven by fresh challenges and the opportunity to learn from them.

If you're seeking a professional who is adaptable, collaborative, and passionate about tackling challenges (with a dash of humor to keep things lively), let's connect. I'm here to contribute to exciting projects and to grow along the way. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
